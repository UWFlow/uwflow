# Backend

This is a collection of services comprising the UWFlow backend.

## Architecture

The architecture is explained in a standalone RFC.

## Requirements

The following packages are required for core functionality:

- `docker`
- `docker-compose`
- `golang`: Mongo and UW API importers

The following packages are required by optional components:

- [`hasura-cli`](https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli.html#install): Hasura web interface

Exact package names may vary across distributions;
for example, Ubuntu refers to `docker` as `docker.io`.
The above list is intended as an unambiguous guideline for humans
and is not necessarily consistent with any single distribution.

## First-time setup

To find out what is really expected, peruse `scripts/sanity-check.sh`
and apply common sense, as the following docs may be outdated.

1. Ensure the required packages are installed (see above).
2. Download and extract the Mongo database dump:
  - Download the file located in Google Drive at `Flow/Data/rmc.zip.gpg`.
  - Run `gpg2 --decrypt rmc.zip.gpg > rmc.zip`.
    Use the password from the [shared vault](uwflow.1password.com).
  - Extract the zip file. This will create a new directory with the Mongo data.
3. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and edit the latter as needed. In particular:
  - `MONGO_DUMP_PATH` should point at the directory obtained at the end of (2)
  - `UW_API_KEY` should be set as instructed in the
    [uwapi-importer README](uwapi-importer/README.md)
  - `POSTGRES_HOST` should be set to `postgres` on \*NIX systems
    and `0.0.0.0` on Windows (which is incidentally otherwise unsupported)

## How to run this

If you have not run the backend before, refer to the preceding section first.
That being done, **simply run `script/start.sh`**.

As dependencies between containers exist that cannot be explicitly specified,
the system will take a while to reach a stable (all services up) state.
The script will wait as this happens, but it should not take more than a minute.
If it does, then something went wrong. Ping `#backend-dev`.

It is instructive to study the script, as it often does not need to be re-run
in its entirety. For example, when developing `api`, it is
not necessary clear database state, so the following command suffices:
```sh
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Interacting with the backend

When `docker-compose` is active, services may be accessed
at their published ports, as declared in `docker-compose.yml`.

To illustrate, the `postgres` service publishes port `5432`, so
```sh
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -u flow
```
will spawn a Postgres shell connected to the database container.
If you do not happen to have `postgres-client` installed, this also works:
```sh
$ docker exec -it postgres sh
(docker) # psql -U postgres flow
```
